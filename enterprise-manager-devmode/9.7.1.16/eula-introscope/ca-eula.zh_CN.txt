# 
# ﻿CA, Inc. ("CA")
# 
# 有关正在安装的 CA 软件产品以及相关文档，和产品中包含的 SDK（定义见下方）（“产品”）的最终用户软件使用许可协议（“协议”）。
# 
# 在安装和使用本产品之前，请仔细阅读以下与您使用本产品有关的条款。在本协议中，您将被称为“您”或者“被许可人”。
# 
# 在下面输入 "accept"，您 
# 
# (I)	宣称自己并非未成年人，并且有完全的法定资格和能力使您自己和您的雇主遵守本协议的条款； 
# (II)	代表您自己和/或在适当的情况下，作为您雇主的授权代表，同意遵守本协议。
# 
# 在下面输入 "reject"，安装过程将会停止。
# 
# 1.  CA（或者产品在北美以外地区提供的情况下，条款 15 之后所列出的提供产品的国家/地区相对应的 CA 的子公司，并且在此情形下，CA 指 CA 子公司）向被许可人提供一份本产品，供一位用户使用、或者按照任何提及本协议条款之订货单（定义见下方）或本产品盒中所带 CD 封套中约定的授权使用限制（“授权使用限制”）中的数量使用。CA 给予被许可人的许可为非排他性质；CA 按照本协议条款以及（a）任何已经由被许可人和 CA 签署的订货单或者注册单之条款；或者（b）CA 提供给被许可人的一份许可程序证书之条款（下方统称为“订货单”）许可被许可人使用本产品。
# 
# 2.  如果本产品是一个 alpha 或者 beta 版，下方称为“beta 程序”或者“beta 版本”，至今尚未普遍供应，则 CA 不保证普遍供应的版本会与 beta 程序完全相同，也不保证普遍供应的版本不需要重新安装。被许可人同意，如果被许可人注册支持服务或经 CA 要求，被许可人应向 CA 提供有关被许可人使用本产品的具体信息。被许可人同意并且承诺产品的 beta 版本（a）仅可被用于测试目的并且非经 CA 事先书面许可不得进行任何生产行为；并且（b）尚未被测试或者调试过，是试验性的，并且文件可能是草稿版本，在很多情况下是不完整的。被许可人同意 CA 对于 beta 版本的完整性、准确性或者被许可人对 beta 版本产品的使用或者操作不做任何保证。Beta 产品基于“现状”提供，并不包括任何明示的或者默示的保证或者陈述，包括但不限于对所有权或者不侵权的保证或者陈述。如果被许可人同时也是本产品 beta 版本的测试人（“测试人”一词在 Beta 测试协议中有所定义，被许可人在收到产品 beta 版本之前的注册过程中已经接受了 Beta 测试协议），被许可人同意，本协议条款为 Beta 测试协议条款的增加，而非替代 Beta 测试协议的条款。
# 
# 3.  如果本产品是一个试用版或者评估版，被许可人同意仅为评估目的并按照上述第 1 条所规定的使用限制使用本产品，评估期间为三十天，除非约定了其他期间（“试用期间”）。试用期间结束后，被许可人使用产品的权利即终止，被许可人同意将产品卸载并且将本产品所有版本退还给 CA，或以书面形式向 CA 保证本产品所有版本已被从被许可人的计算机库和/或存储设备中删除并且销毁。如果被许可人希望在试用期间结束后继续使用本产品，被许可人可与 CA 联系并支付相应费用以获得本产品的使用许可。在试用期间内，被许可人对本产品的使用应基于“现状”原则并不享有任何保证，CA 申明不作任何保证，包括但不限于对商销性、适用于特定目的默示保证以及本协议其他部分做出的任何明示的保证。
# 
# 4.  如果产品包含软件开发工具（SDK），则本段条款与条件仅适用于 SDK 的使用。SDK 可能包含软件、应用编程接口和相关文档。SDK 仅供被许可人内部使用，以开发使得产品与第三方软件或者硬件兼容的软件，或者开发与产品共同使用之软件，例如代理程序。被许可人对 SDK 的使用仅限于帮助被许可人对产品的内部使用。被许可人并未被授权对产品进行任何形式的销售。除下方条款 8 约定的使用限制外，被许可人不得复制、披露、推广或者将 SDK 或者文档或者任何含有 SDK 可执行版本的应用向第三方销售，亦不得置于互联网上，或者超出相应的授权使用限制使用上述可执行版本。如果本条条款与本协议其他条款相冲突，仅在 SDK 使用方面，以本条条款为准。
# 
# 在相关法律允许的最大限度下，尽管本处另有相反约定，SDK 基于“现状”提供，并不包括任何形式的保证。
# 
# 5.  通过支付订货单中所约定的费用或者被许可人与 CA 授权转售商商定的费用，被许可人有权在订货单约定的期间内（“期间”）使用本产品，上述使用应包括在订货单约定的期限内接受维护服务。所有费用需事先支付。被许可人将安装向其提供的本产品的每一个新版本。期间过后，如果被许可人希望继续使用本产品和/或享受维护服务，被许可人应支付订货单中约定的费用。虽然有上述约定，如果本协议在没有订货单的情形下许可使用本产品，被许可人有权无限期使用本产品，但是上述许可不包括接受维护服务的权利。虽然有上述约定，对于依靠持续内容更新的产品，例如签名文件和安全更新，被许可人有权自本许可生效日期起一（1）年内接受内容更新。
# 
# 6.  如果 CA 提供维护，用户需要按照 CA 订货单中的规定每年续订维护。所有费用均不包含应纳税款。被许可人同意于 CA 提示发票后支付任何政府或政府机关征收的关税或税收，包括但不限于国家/地区或地方政府所征收的营业税、使用税、增值税及个人财产税（但 CA 应负的特许费及所得税除外），任何上述税赋的免除均须向 CA 提供适当的免税证明。任何上述税赋的免除均须向 CA 提供适当的免税证明。对于任何被许可人逾期未付款，CA 将收取每月相当于 1.5% 或法令所许可的最高利息两者中的较低者作为利息。
# 
# 7.  被许可人仅限在订货单或者 CD 封套中所指定的地点及计算机设备中使用本产品，以处理本身和持有过半数股份的子公司的资料，但不得超出载明的使用限制范围。如果被许可人希望超出上述限制范围使用本产品，应通知 CA，CA 将开立因该扩展使用而产生的相关费用发票给被许可人，被许可人应支付该相关费用。
# 
# 8.  本产品，包括本处可能提供给被许可人的任何源代码或者目标代码、以及文档、外观、结构和组织，是 CA 和/或其许可人的专属财产，并受版权、专利、商标、商业秘密和/或其他法律的保护。本产品与任何复制品、修改、翻译、部分复制品、编译、衍生作品或者任何 SDK 的合并部分的所有权仍归属于 CA 或者其许可人所有。 本产品的使用权不得用以交换 CA 任何其他产品的使用权。本产品作为单一产品被许可使用。其组成部分不得分开使用。被许可人和其员工需严格确保本产品与本协议条款的机密性，并尽最大努力防止未经授权泄漏或使用本产品。被许可人不得（i）泄露、反向编译、分解或者对本产品进行逆向工程，除非相应法律明文禁止上述限制；（ii）基于本产品开发任何派生产物；（iii）将产品用于提供设施管理，或者将产品用于服务机构或者类似的机构，通过上述机构，被许可人在未向 CA 购买上述目的之许可的情况下，为了未购买产品之第三方的利益操作或者使用产品；或者（iv）未经 CA 事先书面许可允许任何第三方使用产品。未经 CA 事先书面许可，被许可人不得向任何第三方公布产品任何基准测试的结果。被许可人未经 CA 事先书面同意，不得转让、出租、租赁、使用、复制或修改本产品的全部或者部分，或者允许他人进行上述行为，除非相应法律明文禁止上述限制。被许可人不得移除 CA 或其许可人的任何专属标记。被许可人可为备份和灾难复原目的合理复制本产品，但对本产品的实际作业使用应遵照订货单或者 CD 封套中的授权使用限制；且凡用于灾难复原测试目的的产品，在任何三个月的期间内，不得使用超过一个星期。本产品限用于其被购买地点所属国境内使用（除非订货单中另有约定），但 CA 以书面同意者则不在此限。如果本协议因任何理由终止，被许可人需以书面向 CA 保证，本产品的所有版本已经从被许可人的计算机和储存设备中删除，并交还给 CA 或销毁并不再使用。被许可人应当遵守所有进口与出口的法令规定，包括但不局限于美国商业部出口管理局的相关规定。本产品以及所有附随文档均完全由许可人独立承担开发费用，并且作为 FAR 2.101 中定义的“商业产品”“计算机软件”被交付并许可。如果被许可人为美国联邦政府机构，就计算机程序使用规定而言，CA 届时的 GSA FSS 合同的许可条款将取代随程序交付的许可中包含的相应条款。就此目的，术语“产品”和“计算机程序”含义相同。本计算机程序由许可人独立承担开发费用，为商业产品，已发布并已获得版权。代表联邦政府机构购买的第三方仅可根据 FAR 52.227-19(c)(2) 或 DFAR 252.227-7015 中所定义的“有限权利”以及 CA 届时的 GSA FSS 合同向政府转让本计算机程序。所有软件将以发货地 FOB 或电子交付发方式提供。货一旦实际发出或以电子方式交付了密钥/访问代码，则在上述第一时间内，已被视为接受货物。CA 是本产品的生产商。不管是否有其他法律选择条款，本协议适用纽约州的法律，并据以解释。
# 
# 9.  CA保证有权缔结本许可，并保证使被许可人免受损害，防御，或依其选择，和解有关 CA 未经许可或被许可人按许可的方式使用产品侵犯第三方专利、商标或其他知识产权的任何请求。CA 保证产品将符合 CA 公布的规格，但 CA 的唯一责任是尽合理努力遵循产业标准以修补任何瑕疵。CA 对产品操作的保证将仅于被许可人已经支付许可费用和年度维护费的期间有效，或者对于没有订货单的情形，在被许可人获得本产品之许可后的九十（90）天内有效。在接获被许可人以书面通知任何违反上述保证的合理时间内，如果 CA 未能让产品在（a）没有侵犯第三者的知识产权，或（b）符合 CA 书面规格的情况下正常运作，则任何一方可以书面通知对方终止本许可协议，并且在被许可人于上述保证期间内将不合要求的产品连同购买收据交还 CA 或者交还向其提供产品的 CA 授权转售商的前提下，CA 或者授权转售商将向被许可人退还被许可人为该产品支付的相关许可费。本条款所规定的保证不适用于本产品的 beta 版、试用版或评估版，也不适用于软件开发工具。
# 
# 10. 除前述的保证外，在相关法律允许的最大限度下： 
# 
# (I)	CA 不做其他任何保证，无论是明示或默示，包括但不限于商销性和符合特定目的的默示保证； 
# (II)	CA 不对被许可人或任何其他一方可能肇因于本产品的使用、操作或修改所导致的索赔或损失负责，包括时间、金钱、商誉以及间接的损害，即使 CA 被告知有这种损害的可能。如根据所适用的法律上述责任限制无效，则 CA 对这类索赔的责任将局限于被许可人已经实际支付的本产品许可费用的金额。任何第三方，包括代理人、销售商或者 CA 授权转售商，均无权对上述保证作出修改或者代表 CA 做出任何额外的保证。CA 不保证产品满足被许可人的需求，或者产品在使用中不发生错误或产生间断。
# 
# 11.  被许可人只能在其符合 CA 当时适用的许可转让政策时，方可转让本协议，条件之一包括本产品的使用范围未超过被许可人与其持有过半数股份的子公司的业务范围。CA 可转让本许可给承继 CA 对本产品的权益，并承担 CA 在此所述的义务的任何第三者，CA 可将依本许可的收款权利转让第三者或向第三者提供本许可的担保利益或有关收款权。
# 
# 12.  如果被许可人违反本协议的任何条款，或无力偿还债务、或进入破产或接管程序，CA 有权停止履行其义务及/或立即终止本协议，除 CA 享有的其他权利外，被许可人需立即支付所有到期和即将到期的费用给 CA。
# 
# 13.  如果被许可人未支付适用的维护费用，之后可通过支付拖欠期间每年 150% 的维护费用重新取得维护服务。
# 
# 14. 如果法院认为本协议的任何条款为非法、无效或者不可执行，余下的条款应持续完全有效。对本协议的任何违约的弃权不构成对于任何其他违约的弃权，并且弃权需经书面做出并且经弃权方授权代表签字后方为有效。任何有关本协议的问题，请向 CA, Inc. 查询，地址是：One CA Plaza, Islandia, NY 11749，收件人：全球法律部。

#  
# 3.4. Application of Additional Terms.
#  
# You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
#  
# 3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.
#  
# You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor.

#  
# 4.2. Effect of New Versions.
#  
# You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.
#  
# 4.3. Modified Versions.
#  
# When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License.

#  
# 6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.
#  
# 6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as 'Participant') alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.
#

#           that Contributor.
#  
# 3. Distribution Obligations.
#  
#      3.1. Application of License.
#      The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
#      governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
#      Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
#      distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version
#      of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
#      copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
#      distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
#      version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
#      License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include
#      an additional document offering the additional rights described in
#      Section 3.5.
#  
#      3.2. Availability of Source Code.
#      Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
#      made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
#      either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
#      Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
#      Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
#      Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
#      months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
#      (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
#      has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
#      ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
#      Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.
#  
#      3.3. Description of Modifications.
#      You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a
#      file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
#      the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
#      the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
#      Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
#      Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
#      Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
#      origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
#  
#      3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
#           (a) Third Party Claims.
#           If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
#           intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
#           granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
#           Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
#           distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the
#           party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
#           know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after
#           the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
#           Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
#           Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
#           (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
#           reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered
#           Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
#  
#           (b) Contributor APIs.
#           If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
#           interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
#           are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
#           also include this information in the LEGAL file.
#  
#                (c)    Representations.
#           Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
#           Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
#           Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
#           Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
#           this License.
#  
#      3.5. Required Notices.
#      You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
#      Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
#      Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
#      location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
#      to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)
#      You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
#      Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
#      for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
#      rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to
#      charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
#      obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
#      may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
#      Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
#      any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
#      offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
#      Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
#      Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
#      support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
#  
#      3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
#      You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
#      requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
#      and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
#      the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
#      including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
#      obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
#      in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
#      collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
#      Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
#      Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
#      contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
#      compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
#      Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
#      rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
#      License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
#      license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
#      from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
#      Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
#      Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
#      the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
#      terms You offer.
#  
#      3.7. Larger Works.
#      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
#      not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
#      Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
#      requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
#  
# 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
#  
#      If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
#      License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
#      statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
#      the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
#      describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
#      must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
#      be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
#      extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
#      sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
#      understand it.
#  
# 5. Application of this License.
#  
#      This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
#      attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.
#  
# 6. Versions of the License.
#  
#      6.1. New Versions.
#      Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised
#      and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
#      will be given a distinguishing version number.
#  
#      6.2. Effect of New Versions.
#      Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
#      License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
#      version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
#      of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
#      other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to
#      Covered Code created under this License.
#  
#      6.3. Derivative Works.
#      If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
#      only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
#      governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that
#      the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape",
#      "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your
#      license (except to note that your license differs from this License)
#      and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
#      contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
#      Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
#      Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
#      Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
#      this License.)
#  
# 7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
#  
#      COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
#      WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
#      WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF
#      DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
#      THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE
#      IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
#      YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE
#      COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
#      OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
#      ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
#  
# 8. TERMINATION.
#  
#      8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
#      automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
#      such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
#      sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
#      survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
#      nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
#      shall survive.
#  
#      8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
#      claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer
#      or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
#      You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:
#  
#      (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
#      infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
#      Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
#      shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,
#      unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)
#      agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable
#      royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
#      Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
#      the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days
#      of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
#      mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
#      is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under
#      Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of
#      the 60 day notice period specified above.
#  
#      (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
#      Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
#      any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)
#      and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,
#      sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
#      Participant.
#  
#      8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
#      alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
#      indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
#      by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
#      infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
#      granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
#      into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
#      license.
#  
#      8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,
#      all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
#      which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
#      prior to termination shall survive termination.
#  
# 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
#  
#      UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
#      (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
#      DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
#      OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR
#      ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
#      CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
#      WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
#      COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
#      INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
#      LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
#      RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
#      PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
#      EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
#      THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
#  
# 10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
#  
#      The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in
#      48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
#      software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such
#      terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
#      C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
#      all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those
#      rights set forth herein.
#  
# 11. MISCELLANEOUS.
#  
#      This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
#      matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
#      unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
#      necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
#      California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if
#      any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
#      With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,
#      or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United
#      States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be
#      subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
#      District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
#      California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including
#      without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and
#      expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
#      Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
#      Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
#      shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
#      License.
#  
# 12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
#  
#      As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
#      responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
#      out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
#      work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
#      responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
#      shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
#  
# 13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.
#  
#      Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
#      "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial
#      Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under
#      Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified
#      by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

#  
# Disclaimer of Warranty and Exclusive Remedies
#  
# THE PROGRAMS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. WE FURTHER DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS AND IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NONINFRINGEMENT.
#  
# IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA OR DATA USE, INCURRED BY YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION IN CONTRACT OR TORT, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. OUR ENTIRE LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES HEREUNDER SHALL IN NO EVENT EXCEED ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS (U.S. $1,000).
#  
# No Technical Support
# Our technical support organization will not provide technical support, phone support, or updates to you for the programs licensed under this agreement.
#  
# Restricted Rights
# If you distribute a license to the United States government, the programs, including documentation, shall be considered commercial computer software and you will place a legend, in addition to applicable copyright notices, on the documentation, and on the media label, substantially similar to the following:
# NOTICE OF RESTRICTED RIGHTS
# "Programs delivered subject to the DOD FAR Supplement are 'commercial computer software' and use, duplication, and disclosure of the programs, including documentation, shall be subject to the licensing restrictions set forth in the applicable Oracle license agreement. Otherwise, programs delivered subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations are 'restricted computer software' and use, duplication, and disclosure of the programs, including documentation, shall be subject to the restrictions in FAR 52.227-19, Commercial Computer Software-Restricted Rights (June 1987). Oracle USA, Inc., 500 Oracle Parkway, Redwood City, CA 94065."
#  
# End of Agreement
# You may terminate this agreement by destroying all copies of the programs. We have the right to terminate your right to use the programs if you fail to comply with any of the terms of this agreement, in which case you shall destroy all copies of the programs.
#  
# Relationship Between the Parties
# The relationship between you and us is that of licensee/licensor. Neither party will represent that it has any authority to assume or create any obligation, express or implied, on behalf of the other party, nor to represent the other party as agent, employee, franchisee, or in any other capacity. Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to limit either party's right to independently develop or distribute software that is functionally similar to the other party's products, so long as proprietary information of the other party is not included in such software.
#  
# Open Source
# "Open Source" software - software available without charge for use, modification and distribution - is often licensed under terms that require the user to make the user's modifications to the Open Source software or any software that the user 'combines' with the Open Source software freely available in source code form. If you use Open Source software in conjunction with the programs, you must ensure that your use does not: (i) create, or purport to create, obligations of us with respect to the Oracle programs; or (ii) grant, or purport to grant, to any third party any rights to or immunities under our intellectual property or proprietary rights in the Oracle programs. For example, you may not develop a software program using an Oracle program and an Open Source program where such use results in a program file(s) that contains code from both the Oracle program and the Open Source program (including without limitation libraries) if the Open Source program is licensed under a license that requires any "modifications" be made freely available. You also may not combine the Oracle program with programs licensed under the GNU General Public License ("GPL") in any manner that could cause, or could be interpreted or asserted to cause, the Oracle program or any modifications thereto to become subject to the terms of the GPL.
#  
# Entire Agreement
# You agree that this agreement is the complete agreement for the programs and licenses, and this agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or representations. If any term of this agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain effective.

# uninterrupted or error free. TSI's entire liability, and Licensee
# exclusive remedy, under this limited Software Warranty shall be for
# TSI (i) to attempt, through reasonable efforts, to correct any
# reproducible material nonconformity discovered within the ninety (90)
# day warranty period; or (ii) to replace the nonconforming Software

# Section 6, after attempting the remedies described in (i) and (ii)
# above, Licensee may return the Software and TSI shall refund any
# license and maintenance fees paid by Licensee to TSI for the Software.
# The above remedies are available only if TSI is promptly notified in
# writing, within the warranty period, upon discovery of the
# nonconformity by Licensee and TSI's examination of the Software
# discloses that such nonconformity exists, and that the Software has
# not been (i) altered or modified, other than by TSI, (ii) subjected to

# adjusted, or installed other than in accordance with the
# Documentation.  Maintenance Services and Other Services Warranty: TSI

# remedy under this limited Maintenance Services and Other Services
# Warranty shall be for Licensee to recover the fees paid for such
# nonconforming services
# 
# Disclaimer: THE EXPRESS LIMITED WARRANTIES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE
# EXCLUSIVE AND IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR
# STATUTORY WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE, AND TSI EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS
# ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF
# MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
# 
# Limitation of Liability: EXCEPT FOR CLAIMS MADE UNDER SECTION 7
# (INDEMNIFICATION), IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY'S LIABILITY
# ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT
# EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID OR DUE TO TSI HEREUNDER. IN NO EVENT SHALL
# EITHER PARTY HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR
# CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR
# LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE
# GOODS OR SERVICES, ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT UNDER ANY
# CAUSE OF ACTION, WHETHER OR NOT THE OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
# THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY
# NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED
# REMEDY.
# 
# Warranty Claims: Any claims made by Licensee for the breach of a
# warranty set forth in this Section 6, shall be made in writing and
# delivered in writing to TSI, and Licensee shall provide TSI a
# reproducible test case, if applicable, demonstrating the breach of
# warranty.
# 
# 
# Section 7 - Indemnification
# 
# TSI warrants that the use or distribution of unaltered Software
# Program(s), or the exercise of the licenses granted hereunder, will
# not infringe any copyright or patent, or other intellectual property
# rights of any third party, and TSI has all rights necessary for the
# grant of the rights and licenses granted by this Agreement. TSI agrees
# to indemnify, defend and hold Licensee harmless from any and all
# actions, causes of action, claims, demands, reasonable costs,
# liabilities, reasonable expenses (including attorney's fees) and
# damages (collectively, a "Loss" or "Losses") arising from any claim
# that the Software Program infringes any copyright or patent, or other
# intellectual property right of a third party, provided, however:
# (1) Licensee shall promptly deliver to TSI notice in writing of any
#     claim for recovery under this section, and, if known, specify in
#     reasonable detail the nature of the Loss and the amount, or an
#     estimate of the amount, of the liability arising there-from.
#     Licensee shall, at TSI's expense, provide to TSI as promptly as
#     practicable thereafter information and documentation reasonably
#     requested by TSI to support and verify the claim assert-ed,
#     provided that, in so doing, it may restrict or condition any
#     disclosure in the interest of preserving privileges of importance
#     in any foreseeable litigation.
# (2) If the facts pertaining to the Loss arise out of the claim of a
#     third party, or if there is any claim against a third party
#     available by virtue of the circumstances of the Loss, TSI shall
#     assume the defense or the prosecution thereof, including the
#     employment of counsel or accountants, at its cost and expense.
#     Licensee shall have the right to employ counsel separate from
#     counsel employed by TSI in any such action and to participate
#     therein, but the fees and expenses of such counsel employed by
#     Licensee shall be at Licensee expense.  TSI shall have the right
#     to determine and adopt (or, in the case of a proposal by Licensee,
#     to approve) a settlement of such matter in its reasonable
#     discretion. TSI shall not be liable for any settlement of any
#     claim effected without its prior written consent, which shall not
#     be unreasonably withheld.  Whether or not TSI chooses to so
#     defend or prosecute such claim, Licensee and TSI shall cooperate
#     in the defense or prosecution thereof and shall furnish such
#     records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences,
#     discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals, as may be
#     reasonably requested in connection therewith.
# (3) If such a claim arises, or in either party's judgment is likely
#     to arise, Licensee agree to allow TSI, at TSI's option, to either
#     (i) procure the right to permit the continued exercise of the
#     rights and licenses in the Software Program granted under this
#     Agreement; (ii) replace or modify the Software Program so it
#     be-comes non-infringing, while affording equivalent performance;
#     or (iii) as its sole obligation, terminate the license for the
#     infringing Software Program and upon return thereof by Licensee,
#     refund the unearned portion of any license fees paid by Licensee
#     for the remainder of the current term hereof.
# (4) TSI shall have no indemnity obligation for claims of infringement
#     resulting from any combination, operation or use of the Software
#     Program, or any components thereof, with any software programs or
#     data not supplied by TSI if such infringement would have been
#     avoided by use of the Software Program alone. Licensee
#     acknowledges and agrees that these four items are the exclusive
#     remedy of Licensee for damages for breach of warranty or
#     representations contained in this Section 7.
# 
# 
# Section 8 - Termination
# 
# Should either party commit a material breach of its obligations
# hereunder, the other party may, at its option, terminate this
# Agreement by written notice to the party in default. Such notice
# shall identify and describe the default upon which termination is
# based. The defaulting party shall have thirty (30) days from the
# effective delivery of the notice to cure such default, which, if
# effected, shall prevent termination by virtue of such default.  Upon
# termination of this Agreement, Licensee will either return to TSI or
# destroy all copies of the Software Program and documentation then in
# your possession.  Licenses to the Software Program granted in the
# normal course of business by Licensee to your customers shall survive
# termination of this Agreement.  Licensee shall, within thirty (30)
# days after the date of such termination furnish TSI with a certificate
# of compliance in accordance with this Section.  The parties agree that
# TSI shall have the right to enforce the obligations arising under this
# Section by seeking specific performance and to enjoin or compel
# Licensee through injunctive relief. Licensee may retain a commercially
# reasonable number of copies of the Software Program and documentation
# solely for the purpose of supporting Licensee customers.

# Sub-directories of the directory named "src" of certain Plug-ins 
# Feature directories 
# Note: if a Feature made available by the Eclipse Foundation is installed using the Eclipse Update Manager, you must agree to a license ("Feature Update License") during the installation process. If the Feature contains Included Features, the Feature Update License should either provide you with the terms and conditions governing the Included Features or inform you where you can locate them. Feature Update Licenses may be found in the "license" property of files named "feature.properties" found within a Feature. Such Abouts, Feature Licenses, and Feature Update Licenses contain the terms and conditions (or references to such terms and conditions) that govern your use of the associated Content in that directory.

# LICENSE AGREEMENT AND LIMITED PRODUCT WARRANTY
# RED HATÃƒ?Ã¢??Ãƒ?Ã‚Â® ENTERPRISE LINUXÃƒ?Ã¢??Ãƒ?Ã‚Â® VERSION 4
# 
# This agreement governs the use of the Software and any updates to the
# Software, regardless of the delivery mechanism.  The Software is a
# collective work under U.S. Copyright Law.  Subject to the following
# terms, Red Hat, Inc. (?Red Hat?) grants to the user (?Customer?) a
# license to this collective work pursuant to the GNU General Public
# License.
# 
# 1.  The Software.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux (the ?Software?) is a
#     modular operating system consisting of hundreds of software
#     components.  The end user license agreement for each component is
#     located in the component's source code.  With the exception of
#     certain image files identified in Section 2 below, the license
#     terms for the components permit Customer to copy, modify, and
#     redistribute the component, in both source code and binary code
#     forms.  This agreement does not limit Customer's rights under, or
#     grant Customer rights that supersede, the license terms of any
#     particular component.
# 
# 2.  Intellectual Property Rights.  The Software and each of its
#     components, including the source code, documentation, appearance,
#     structure and organization are owned by Red Hat and others and are
#     protected under copyright and other laws.  Title to the Software
#     and any component, or to any copy, modification, or merged portion
#     shall remain with the aforementioned, subject to the applicable
#     license.  The ?Red Hat? trademark and the ?Shadowman? logo are
#     registered trademarks of Red Hat in the U.S. and other countries.
#     This agreement does not permit Customer to distribute the Software
#     using Red Hat's trademarks.  Customer should read the information
#     found at http://www.redhat.com/about/corporate/trademark/ before
#     distributing a copy of the Software, regardless of whether it has
#     been modified.  If Customer makes a commercial redistribution of
#     the Software, unless a separate agreement with Red Hat is executed
#     or other permission granted, then Customer must modify the files
#     identified as ?REDHAT-LOGOS? and ?anaconda-images? to remove all
#     images containing the ?Red Hat? trademark or the ?Shadowman? logo.
#     Merely deleting these files may corrupt the Software.
# 
# 3.  Limited Warranty.  Except as specifically stated in this agreement
#     or a license for a particular component, to the maximum extent
#     permitted under applicable law, the Software and the components
#     are provided and licensed ?as is? without warranty of any kind,
#     expressed or implied, including the implied warranties of
#     merchantability, non-infringement or fitness for a particular
#     purpose.  Red Hat does not warrant that the functions contained in
#     the Software will meet Customer's requirements or that the
#     operation of the Software will be entirely error free or appear
#     precisely as described in the accompanying documentation. This
#     warranty extends only to the party that purchases the Software
#     from Red Hat or a Red Hat authorized distributor.
# 
# 4.  Limitation of Remedies and Liability. To the maximum extent
#     permitted by applicable law, the remedies described below are
#     accepted by Customer as its only remedies.  Red Hat's entire
#     liability, and Customer's exclusive remedies, shall be: If the
#     Software media is defective, Customer may return it within 30 days
#     of delivery along with a copy of Customer's payment receipt and
#     Red Hat, at its option, will replace it or refund the money paid
#     by Customer for the Software.  To the maximum extent permitted by
#     applicable law, Red Hat or any Red Hat authorized dealer will not
#     be liable to Customer for any incidental or consequential damages,
#     including lost profits or lost savings arising out of the use or
#     inability to use the Software, even if Red Hat or such dealer has
#     been advised of the possibility of such damages.  In no event
#     shall Red Hat's liability under this agreement exceed the amount
#     that Customer paid to Red Hat under this agreement during the
#     twelve months preceding the action.
# 
# 5.  Export Control.  As required by U.S. law, Customer represents and
#     warrants that it: (a) understands that the Software is subject to
#     export controls under the U.S. Commerce Department?s Export
#     Administration Regulations (?EAR?); (b) is not located in a
#     prohibited destination country under the EAR or U.S. sanctions
#     regulations (currently Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan
#     and Syria); (c) will not export, re-export, or transfer the
#     Software to any prohibited destination, entity, or individual
#     without the necessary export license(s) or authorizations(s) from
#     the U.S. Government; (d) will not use or transfer the Software for
#     use in any sensitive nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, or
#     missile technology end-uses unless authorized by the
#     U.S. Government by regulation or specific license; (e) understands
#     and agrees that if it is in the United States and exports or
#     transfers the Software to eligible end users, it will, as required
#     by EAR Section 741.17(e), submit semi-annual reports to the
#     Commerce Department?s Bureau of Industry & Security (BIS), which
#     include the name and address (including country) of each
#     transferee; and (f) understands that countries other than the
#     United States may restrict the import, use, or export of
#     encryption products and that it shall be solely responsible for
#     compliance with any such import, use, or export restrictions.
# 
# 6.  Third Party Programs. Red Hat may distribute third party software
#     programs with the Software that are not part of the Software.
#     These third party programs are subject to their own license terms.
#     The license terms either accompany the programs or can be viewed
#     at http://www.redhat.com/licenses/.  If Customer does not agree to
#     abide by the applicable license terms for such programs, then
#     Customer may not install them.  If Customer wishes to install the
#     programs on more than one system or transfer the programs to
#     another party, then Customer must contact the licensor of the
#     programs.
# 
# 7.  General.  If any provision of this agreement is held to be
#     unenforceable, that shall not affect the enforceability of the
#     remaining provisions.  This agreement shall be governed by the
#     laws of the State of North Carolina and of the United States,
#     without regard to any conflict of laws provisions, except that the
#     United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods shall
#     not apply.
