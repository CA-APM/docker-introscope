# Description:
# ------------
#
# This is a small test case that creates two enterprise managers running in Collector mode (each having their
# own database). For each of these collectors a sample application (simple EPAgent) is connected in order for
# us to see some data.
# A central enterprise manager running as cross-cluster-viewer (cdv) is used to read the data from these
# enterprise managers and provide them with a webui.
#
# A similar example (with added MOMs) can also be run in production like environments. This shows how easy
# the setup of Introscope can be with the help of Docker.
